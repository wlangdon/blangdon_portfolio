		<p><strong>Where to Stay:</strong>Take a pass on Montauk’s dated, overpriced beachfront motels in favor of a recently renovated room at the Sunrise Guest House (from $125; from $150 after June 21), less than a mile west of town and a mere 300 feet from the beach. To save a few bucks, book a room without views—you can still gaze at the ocean while sipping your morning coffee on the back porch.</p> <p>The brand-new Lakeside Inn’s (from $190) modern, minimally decorated rooms have fabulous decks and oversize showers with river-rock floors and teak ceilings. The inn piles on the freebies: There’s a complimentary glass of Champagne every evening, beach-cruiser bikes for morning exercise, and paddleboats and kayaks for lazy floats on the adjacent Fort Pond.</p><p>Formerly the Shepherds Neck Inn, the resortlike Solé East reopened on June 7 (from $160; from $240 after June 29) with updated rooms sporting hardwood and black-slate floors. The inn provides free shuttle service to and from the Jitney and train station, and will even taxi guests to the beach—great if you don’t feel like lugging your gear fifteen minutes to the dunes.</p>
		<p><strong>What to Do:</strong>Though Southampton and East Hampton get all the attention, Montauk’s natural beauty is unrivaled on the East End. Over 500 feet of beautiful, clean, and uncrowded sand can be found at Kirk Park Beach, just west of the village, beside the IGA market. Public parking—a rarity in these parts—costs $15 per day.</p><p>A half-mile east of Montauk, Shadmoor State Park features unique, moorlike terrain and elevated platforms offering spectacular vistas. Hike the 1¼-mile loop trail through the scrubland, gawking at panoramic ocean views from the tops of 70- to 100-foot bluffs.</p><p>For some of the best mountain biking on Long Island, rent wheels from Montauk Bike Shop (from $9 an hour or $35 a day) and make the classic, hilly pilgrimage to the Montauk Lighthouse. Or pick up a $7 Ride Guide and explore the many trails and vistas in sprawling Hither Woods, west of the village.</p><p>The jetty at Ditch Plains Beach creates consistently rideable waves, suitable for both long- and short-boarders and beginners. When it gets too crowded, seasoned surfers should check out the breaks at Turtle Cove (located below the Montauk lighthouse) or Camp Hero State Park. Rent boards or sign up for lessons at Air and Speed Board Shop (795 Montauk Highway; 631-668-0356).</p>
